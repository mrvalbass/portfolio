        Specializing in physics and chemistry, this program aimed to provide the
        fundamental knowledge necessary to excel in competitive examinations for
        admission to one of France&apos;s top engineering schools. <br /> <br />
        It constituted the most demanding part of my education, teaching me how
        to thrive under pressure and emphasizing the importance of

        Engineering school taught me organic chemistry and began shaping my
        career path. It led me to the discovery of food flavour chemistry, a
        field where the results of your experiments are immediately observable
        through smell and taste, offering the fulfillment I seek in my work.{" "}

        <br /> With this career path defined, I sought to deepen my

        programming for the first time here (VBA). It was so enjoyable and

        After training me in the last years of my education, MANE&apos;s
        investment in me led to a job offer. I became savoury formula management

        My job was to ensure that regardless of the crises affecting our

        working under the pressure of the latest crisis and we had to always be
        innovative to solve the problems we were facing. <br /> Being at the
        crossroads of R&D, Purchasing, Regulatory and Production, I was given
        the responsibility of managing the raw material library for savoury
        formulation.
        <br /> Finally, I learned Python and a little bit of Machine Learning on
        my own to automate some tasks, so R&D asked me to manage the development
        of new tools to improve R&D efficiency which ended up in the projects
